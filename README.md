Code for NeurIPS 2019 paper: 

F. Li and M. Bowling. **Ease-of-Teaching and Language Structure from Emergent Communication**. 

The code is written in 

Python: 3.6

Pytorch: 0.4.1

To reproduce experiments results of perfect language and permuted language, run `nonNN_perfect.py` and `nonNN_permuted.py`.

To reproduce experiments results of sequential reset and no-reset, run `reset50_eval.py` and `noreset50_eval.py`.

To reproduce experiments results of population staggered reset, population simultaneous reset, population no-reset, run `pop_uni.py`, `pop_resetall.py`, and `pop_noreset.py`, respectively.
